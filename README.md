Setting up C++ development on a Mac with an M2 chip (such as the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro) is very similar to setting it up on an Intel-based Mac. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Install Xcode**:
   - Open the Mac App Store.
   - Search for "Xcode" and click on the "Get" button to install it.
   - Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) and includes the necessary tools and compilers for C++ development.

2. **Command Line Tools**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the Xcode command line tools, which include the C++ compiler (`g++`) and other development utilities:
     ```
     xcode-select --install
     ```

3. **Install Homebrew (Optional)**:
   - Homebrew is a package manager that makes it easy to install various development tools and libraries. You can choose to skip this step, but it's highly recommended for managing C++ libraries and dependencies.

   - To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run:
     ```
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
     ```

4. **Install GCC** (Optional but recommended):
   - By default, macOS includes the Clang/LLVM C++ compiler, which is sufficient for many projects. However, you can install GCC for a more traditional C++ development environment:

     - If you've installed Homebrew, you can use it to install GCC:
       ```
       brew install gcc
       ```

5. **Write and Compile C++ Code**:
   - You can now write C++ code in your preferred text editor or IDE. Save your C++ files with a `.cpp` extension.

   - To compile your C++ program using GCC, you can use a command like this:
     ```
     g++ <FileName>.cpp -o <ExecuatbleName>
     ```

6. **Run Your Program**:
   - After compiling your program, you can run it from the Terminal:
     ```
     ./<ExecuatbleName>
     ```

7. **Open <FileName>.cpp so that it is the active file.**

8. **Press the play button in the top right corner of the editor.**

9. **Choose C/C++: clang++ build and debug active file from the list of detected compilers on your system.**

10. **Open a new Terminal window in Visual studio and just run ./<ExecuatbleName>**

11. **If still error, click on Search, Run task --> Select C/C++: clang++ build and debug active file**
